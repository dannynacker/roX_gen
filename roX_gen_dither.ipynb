        "This script generates periodic or aperiodic waveforms of matched flash counts and total on durations SPECIFIC to the parameter constraints set forth by WP1 (3 - 15 Hz, 25 - 75 % Duty Cycle).\n",

        "\n",
        "For each step, these values are stored in step_params. The script also prepares a bin to store flash counts of the periodic step (for help in generating a matched aperiodic step) as well as their on times. These are used to generate a list of interflash intervals, which are plotted for the sequence at the end of the script. As such, to aid in visualization, I recommend using this script to only generate two steps at a time (compare the periodic and aperiodic versions of the step you wish to build) -- you can easily append additional STP lines on top of each other later, and manually or automatically correct the TIM and DUR stamps at the top of the completed roX .txt file.\n",
        "\n",
        "For each step, mean frequency and duty cycle are computed, as well as the total number of flashes (based on these means) and the expected total on duration (based on the above three variables).\n",
        "\n",
        "If a step is PERIODIC, we only produce one STP line, as its duration is likely much longer than the device's minimum (100ms) and as such the device is capable of linearly interpolating across start and end values for frequency, duty cycle, and luminance WITHIN an STP line; this is not true for very granular STP lengths, such as the 100ms minimum that we enforce for matched aperiodic wave generation.\n",
        "\n",
        "If a step is APERIODIC, this script draws from the calculated expected flashes and on time from a matched periodic wave, and attempts to generate over a series of trials to find good candidates for frequency and duty cycle (clamped to the parameter range set forth by WP1) which allow for matched flash counts and on durations, while penalizing \"boundary hits\" (i.e., a flash frequency of 3 or 15, or a duty cycle of 25 or 75) so that the script doesn't force-match wave characteristics too early and have to fill the rest of the period with boundary dynamics (i.e., multiple 3 Hz flashes at varying duty cycles to try to adhere to matching the periodic wave). This ensures that the maximum amount of jitter can be applied to a step specific to the parameters within that step.\n",
        "\n",
        "Eventually, duty cycle and frequency end their dance together, and matched flash counts and on durations are found, so the script moves on to formatting these steps into roX language.\n",
        "\n",
        "RoX language is probably copyrighted, so that will not be explained here.\n",
        "\n",
        "The interflash intervals between the waves are then plotted and overlayed so one can see the narrow interval of the periodic wave (a cluster around 1 / mean_freq) compared to the jittered distribution of a matched aperiodic wave (assuming you created the same periodic and aperiodic waveform).\n",
        "\n",
        "Future updates will include the automatic production of a step of opposing periodicity (so that two steps don't have to be manually generated each time for variability comparison), but, without verification of aperiodicity from a photodiode, we will allow for step-by-step, periodicity-by-periodicity manual verification of jittered interval distribution."
